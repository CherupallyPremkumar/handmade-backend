Feature: Testcase ID 2
Tests the inventory Workflow Service using a REST client. Inventory service exists and is under test.
It helps to create a inventory and manages the state of the inventory as documented in states xml

Scenario: Create a new inventory
Given that "flowName" equals "inventoryFlow"
And that "initialState" equals "CREATED"
When I construct a REST request with authorization header in realm "tenant0" for user "t0-premium" and password "t0-premium"
And I construct a REST request with header "x-chenile-tenant-id" and value "tenant0"
When I POST a REST request to URL "/inventory" with payload
"""json
{
    "description": "Description"
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.id" from response to "id"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "${initialState}"
And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" from response to "currentState"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.description" is "Description"

Scenario: Retrieve the inventory that just got created
When I construct a REST request with authorization header in realm "tenant0" for user "t0-premium" and password "t0-premium"
And I construct a REST request with header "x-chenile-tenant-id" and value "tenant0"
When I GET a REST request to URL "/inventory/${id}"
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "${currentState}"


Scenario: Send the stock event to the inventory with comments
Given that "comment" equals "Comment for stock"
And that "event" equals "stock"
When I construct a REST request with authorization header in realm "tenant0" for user "t0-premium" and password "t0-premium"
And I construct a REST request with header "x-chenile-tenant-id" and value "tenant0"
When I PATCH a REST request to URL "/inventory/${id}/${event}" with payload
"""json
{
    "comment": "${comment}"
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "IN_STOCK"
And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" from response to "finalState"

Scenario: Send the lowStock event to the inventory with comments
Given that "comment" equals "Comment for lowStock"
And that "event" equals "lowStock"
When I construct a REST request with authorization header in realm "tenant0" for user "t0-premium" and password "t0-premium"
And I construct a REST request with header "x-chenile-tenant-id" and value "tenant0"
When I PATCH a REST request to URL "/inventory/${id}/${event}" with payload
"""json
{
    "comment": "${comment}"
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "LOW_STOCK"
And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" from response to "finalState"

Scenario: Send the outOfStock event to the inventory with comments
Given that "comment" equals "Comment for outOfStock"
And that "event" equals "outOfStock"
When I construct a REST request with authorization header in realm "tenant0" for user "t0-premium" and password "t0-premium"
And I construct a REST request with header "x-chenile-tenant-id" and value "tenant0"
When I PATCH a REST request to URL "/inventory/${id}/${event}" with payload
"""json
{
    "comment": "${comment}"
}
"""
Then the REST response contains key "mutatedEntity"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.id" is "${id}"
And the REST response key "mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" is "OUT_OF_STOCK"
And store "$.payload.mutatedEntity.currentState.stateId" from response to "finalState"
